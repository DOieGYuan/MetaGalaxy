# Wrapper scripts

These wrapper scripts are modifications of the orginal scripts, to allow the local Galaxy to use metaFlye and Krona from the MetaGalaxy pipeline
The orginal wrapper for Flye was made by [bgruening](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools/tree/master/tools/flye)
The orginal wrapper for Krona was made by [crs4](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/taxonomy_krona_chart)
Paths were hardcoded and are changed in these files for privacy reasons. When implemented into a local Galaxy, these scripts should still work.
